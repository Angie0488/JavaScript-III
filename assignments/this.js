/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding is used in the global scope, and assigns the window object 
to the this keyword.

* 2.  Implicit binding uses whatever function that is called with a dot, 
and takes the object named before the dot to bind to the this keyword.

* 3. New binding works with constructor functions, and uses the this keyword 
to bind the object created and returned by the constructor function.

* 4. Explicit binding uses the .call and .apply to override what the main 
constructor function was first set to. 

*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
